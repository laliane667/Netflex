âœ… Step 4: Extract the previously downloaded files, then drag and drop the content inside Netflex/src/resources/Movies (IMPORTANT: the content should be
           some folders named by movie title).

âœ… Step 5: Open phpMyAdmin. Create a new database in the left panel. Name it "NetFlex". Click on the database you've created. Then click on "Import" at 
           the top of your screen. Select NetFlex.sql in the Netflex folder you've extracted at Step 1. Finally, import the database.

âœ… Step 6: Don't close phpMyAdmin. Still in the NetFlex database, copy the server's name (ex: localhost:8889). Then in the file ConnectionController 
           in src/dependencies/Controller/ConnectionController, change the URL server with your server address. Also, change the username and password 
           if needed.
